# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains algorithm implementations, datasets used for testing and
unit tests. Use `create_algorithm.py` to scaffold new algorithms.

## Requirements

Two requirements files are provided:

* `requirements.txt` - full dependencies for running the project locally.
* `requirements-pages.txt` - smaller set used when building the documentation.



# This project has been vibe coded to hell and beyond. CBA to define a proper structure for now.
